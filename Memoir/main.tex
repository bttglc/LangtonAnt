\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview}
Langton's ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. 
An "ant" moves on a grid of cells that can be either white or black: depending on the color of the cell it stands on, the ant 
inverts the color of the cell it stands on at the start and then moves in a certain direction or in the opposite one depending
on the original color of the starting cell. 
The first few thousands moves produce simple patterns that are often symmetric and repetitive, but after around 11000 moves 
the ant starts moving in a repetitive manner, creating a "highway" pattern that keeps repeating itself indefinitely.

\subsection{Historical background}
Langton's ant was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 while he was a graduate student at the University of Michigan.
It is one of the first and most famous examples of artificial life: in the 40 years that followed, it gave birth to multiple 
variations, ranging from version with multiple colors, to multiple ants, to different shapes of grids and cells, and it's still object 
of research and debate among computer scientist.

\subsection{Contents of the report}
The goal of this paper is to give the reader the tools to summarily understand the problem to then introduce an overview of the state of the art 
of Langton's ant and to finally present the results of an experiment we conducted on a finite, all-white starting grid with wrap-around properties.
The main goal of our explorative work was to observe the properties of the problem in a more limited and less studied scenario to try and derive some interesting
conclusions, familiarising with rigorous formulation of properties, simulations, data collection, data analysis and hypothesis formulation.

Section 2 consists of a series of simple explaination of fundamental concepts behind the problem.

Section 3 is a brief overview of the state of the art of Langton's ant, with a final part focused on the most recent findings and open questions.

Section 4 is the core of the paper, where we present our experiment, the results and the analysis of the results.

Section 5 is a brief overview of the code we used to conduct the experiment.

Section 6 is a brief overview of related topics.

Section 7 constitutes the conclusion of the paper and includes our hypothesis and further questions.
